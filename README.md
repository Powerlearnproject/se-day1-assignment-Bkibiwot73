#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves the use of a systematic method in the designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining of software based on engineering principles. It ensures that software systems are reliable, scalable, efficient, and economical.

Importance in the Technology Industry:
- Ensures Quality: Helps develop high-quality, bug-free, and sustainable software.
- Enhances Efficiency: Streamlines the development process to conserve time and funds.
- Enhances Security: Uses secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Enables Scalability: Helps build software that can grow with business needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. 1968 - Software Engineering came into existence
- The NATO conference witnessed the first usage of the term "software engineering" to refer to the "software crisis" being created due to poor development practices.

2. 1980s - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) enters the scene
- Programming languages like C++ and later Java revolutionized software design by promoting modularity and reusability of code.

3. 2001 - The Agile Manifesto
- Brought in a flexible, iterative method of software development, moving away from fixed traditional models.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Defining objectives, scope, and feasibility.
Requirements Analysis: Gathering user needs and documenting them.
Design: Creating architecture, database structure, and UI/UX.
Implementation (Coding): Writing and compiling code.
Testing: Verifying functionality, performance, and security.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues after release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.  

Waterfall is a linear and structured approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) happens sequentially. It works best for projects with well-defined requirements, like government or banking systems.  

Agile is a flexible, iterative approach where development happens in small increments with continuous feedback and testing. It is ideal for projects that require frequent updates, such as mobile apps and websites.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer: Codes, tests, and debugs code.
- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Verifies software to make certain quality requirements are achieved.
- Project Manager: Directs, organizes, and oversees timelines, budget, and communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
-Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
-Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

Version Control Systems (VCS)
-Help track changes and collaborate on code.
-Examples: Git, SVN.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Debugging complex code → Use debugging tools and write unit tests.
-Changing requirements → Follow Agile methodology for flexibility.
-Technical debt (messy code due to shortcuts) → Refactor code regularly and follow clean coding practices.
-Security risks → Implement secure coding standards, conduct security audits, and use encryption.
-Tight deadlines → Use proper project management techniques and realistic planning.
-Collaboration issues in teams → Use communication tools like Slack and project tracking tools like Jira or Trello.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., a function in a calculator).
-Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together (e.g., login and payment systems).
-System Testing: Validates the entire software system (e.g., end-to-end e-commerce checkout).
-Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets business needs before release (e.g., user acceptance testing).


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating very well-structured and specific prompts to get the most out of AI responses. Prompt engineering has a great impact on the performance, accuracy of AI models, and reducing confusion.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain artificial intelligence, including its definition, key types (narrow and general AI), and real-world applications in healthcare, finance, and automation."

Why is the Improved Prompt Better?

Specific: Requests a detailed explanation.
Concise: Clearly defines the scope.
Contextual: Guides the AI to focus on relevant aspects.
